In this project we try to make the use of the javascript canvas more easy, simple and fast.

Take a look:
http://thiagomata.github.com/CanvasBox/

This project was born into the codetodiagram project, which needs a better Web GUI. 
But, as this javascript project grow up, we decided to make this javascript library a project itself.

There is not a lot documentation yet, but we are working on it.

Take a look in the code and into the examples into http://www.replicantowl.com/canvasbox/CanvasBox/src/ 
and http://thiagomata.github.com/CanvasBox/ and you will see how this project it is very easy to understand 
and very cool to use it.

I hope you like it.
